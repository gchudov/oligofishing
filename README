This script allows to perform large scale nucleotide sequence matching. It accepts and outputs sequences in FASTA format. 


The best application of oligofishing script is to match large number of short oligonucleotides (primers) against large set of sequences (usually NextGen sequencing data).
It is advised to do matching against a set of relatively short sequences (100bp - 1000bp) as script will not output the matching region of the sequence but only its name with entire sequence.  

1.INSTALL
		$ cd oligofishing
		$ make
	
2.RUN

		$ oligofishing -h hooks.fasta -p pond_NGS.fasta > out.fasta

Matching (fishing) is done with two FASTA files, "Hooks" (-h, --hook) and "Pond" (-p, --pond). 
"Hooks" are short oligonucleotide (primers) sequences that will be matched against every sequence in "Pond" file. 
Note that if your sequences contain ambiguous characters they will not be interpreted as such. 
For example, if "Hook" is 'ATCCCG' and "Pond" sequence is 'ATNCCG' they WILL NOT be matched. Similarly, if "Hook" is 'ATCNNN' and "Pond" sequence is 'ATCNNN' they WILL be matched.

OUTPUT: Those sequences in the "Pond" which have regions with perfect match to one of the "Hooks" will go in standart output in FASTA format.
Name of each sequence in output FASTA file is the combination of the name of the sequence from "Pond" and the name of the "Hook" it was fished out with, separated by '|' character. 
Sequence name example: ">pond_seq_1|hook_seq_1"
